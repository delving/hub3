    - sip-core (only within sip-grpc)
- OCR pdf sandwhich (WBSO):
    - experiment with tesseract
    - extract XML for coordinates
    - investigate native PDF internal model with coordinates
    - create POC with google vision json output
    - downsample the images
- point in time (revision store):
    - investigate go-git
    - create workflow for storing and retrieving based on key
    - integrate indexing pipe-line with revision store
    - phase out integer revision based orphan control
    - implement scheduled sync between revesion store and index
    - integrate revision store with OAI-PMH endpoint
    - integration revision store with Site-Map generator
- Ci/CD workflow for building and deploying
- lean-web front-end
    - experiment with vanillajs and gohtml front-end
- RAML console
    - plan for reverse engineering of all API documentation in RAML
    - integrate RAML in builds
- Ikuzo rapid replacement
    - replace rapid indexing
    - add v1 indexing option to revision store
    - separate head metadata and source in separate fields (two step updating)
    - create v1 convertor from v2 API
    - test with instant website
    - setup e2e testing with small sets from EB and check if output is the same as golden samples
- V2 diw project
    - add babel transpiling based buiding to grunt
    - replace jquery templates with lit-html
    - create classes for various functionality
    - refactor out query and results into separate functions where we can inject options to transparently switch between v1 and v2
- ES new indexer
    - integrate with revision store
    - use vice interface to transport layer
    - implement bulk indexer based on vice (no records can be lost)
    - determine how often to flush
    - only send deltas
    - have daily sync mechanism to make sure nothing is lost
- Hub3 V2
    - move nave code to hub3
    - move narthex code to hub3
    - move sip-creator code to hub3 dashboard
- logging, metrics and tracing
    - add expvar endpoint
    - add prometheus endpoint
    - use zerolog for structured logging
    - add library for opencensus based tracing
- new delving website
    - create simple website with hugo
    - reuse current styling
    - determine what information should be present
- go media manager
    - deep zoom generator and serving
    - extract metadata (exif) from images
    - color extracting
    - RDF endpoint for metadata
    - cache endpoint for external digital objects
    - document storage (PDF)
    - spin 3d support
    - dashboard for statistics and exploration
    - dynamic resizing
    - digital fingerprinting
    - similarity fingerprinting
    - key fingerprinting
    - linking to hub3 labels for better matching 
- fixed test data
    - create demo org with test data
    - this org should always be loaded to test correct behaviour
- migrate elasticsearch away from ES hosted service
    - setup kubernetes or metal hosted cluster
    - implement group-cache based caching to reduce pressure on elasticsearch
- implemnation and integration of groupcache
