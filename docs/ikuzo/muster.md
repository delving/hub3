The muster file contains a backlog of functionality to implement in priority order. When an item is finished it should be moved to the done subsection with a git-sha1 and a timestamp.

## TODO

- create custom XML to EAD/RiC-O parser with validation for EAD. 
- Use RiC-O for internal model for EAD, see https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/RiC-O_v0-1.html
