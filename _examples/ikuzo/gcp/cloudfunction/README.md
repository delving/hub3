# Cloud function deployment

Make sure your system is setup based on the [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/first-go) in section "Creating a GCP project using Cloud SDK". Then you are ready to run the deploy script:

    `$ sh ./bin/deploy.sh`

Run the cleanup script to remove the cloud function:

    `$ sh ./bin/cleanup.sh`
