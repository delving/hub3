# Appengine deployment

Make sure your system is setup based on the [quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/quickstart) for Appengine and Go 1.12. Follow the quickstart until 'Download the Hello World app'. Then you are ready to run the deploy script:

    `$ sh ./bin/deploy.sh`



Caveat: until this project is open-sourced this example-project must be part of the GO-PATH in order to resolve dependencies.
